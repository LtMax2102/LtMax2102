Im Jamie, I've been programming for 5 years and have a degree in Computing, I mainly work with web tools like HTML and JS, Python, or C++ as these are the languages I find the most fun to use, Although i'm willing to learn any.
All of the repositories you can find contain some of the code I've written in the last couple years, Enjoy.
